# Portty configuration
# Place this file at ~/.config/portty/config.toml

# Path to the portty-builtin binary (default: /usr/lib/portty/portty-builtin)
# builtin_path = "/usr/lib/portty/portty-builtin"

# Default terminal command for all portals
# Set to empty string or omit for headless mode (CLI only)
[default]
exec = "foot"

# Override for specific portals
[file-chooser]
exec = "foot"

# Headless mode example - no terminal, use `portty` CLI only:
# [file-chooser]
# exec = ""
#
# Usage in headless mode:
#   1. Browser opens file dialog
#   2. Run: portty select /path/to/file.txt
#   3. Run: portty submit
#
# Submission queue:
#   Pre-queue file selections before dialogs open:
#     portty select file1.txt file2.txt   # Add to pending
#     portty select file3.txt             # Add more
#     portty submit                       # Bundle into submission
#
#   When a dialog opens, queued submissions are auto-applied.
#   Use --queue to view pending/submissions:
#     portty --queue
#
#   Use --immediate (-i) for direct execution to active session:
#     portty -i select file.txt

# Custom commands available in the session
# These are added to $PATH alongside the default builtins (sel, submit, cancel)
[file-chooser.bin]
# Quick pick with fzf
pick = "fzf --multi | sel --stdin"
# Preview files
preview = "bat \"$@\""

# Future portals:
# [screenshot]
# exec = "foot -e screenshot-picker"
